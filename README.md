# Summary
This project simulates a robotic arm to extend, grab an object, and contract using the Logic Step Board FPGA provided by the Waterloo Engineering Endowment Fund.

Implemented in VHDL, this project uses various buttons as controls (i.e. to extend, contract, grab, or release), after which the appropriate LED's will flash or remain turned on to indicate the status of the arm (e.g. fully contracted).
